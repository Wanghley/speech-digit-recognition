# Executive Summary

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of spoken digits using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The study focuses on developing a robust system for analyzing and classifying spoken digits through advanced statistical modeling techniques.

# Introduction

## Background and Motivation

Speech recognition technology has become a cornerstone of human-computer interaction, powering applications from virtual assistants to automated customer service systems. This project focuses on the specific challenge of spoken digit recognition, which serves as an excellent starting point for more complex speech recognition tasks.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

- Examine and characterize the distribution of MFCC features extracted from spoken digits
- Implement and evaluate GMM clustering for modeling different pronunciations
- Analyze likelihood distributions across different digits
- Create visualizations to understand the underlying patterns in speech data

## Scope and Limitations

This study focuses on:

- Single-speaker digit recognition
- Isolated digit pronunciation (not continuous speech)
- Clean audio recordings without background noise

# Theoretical Framework

## Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)

### Overview
MFCCs are coefficients that collectively represent the short-term power spectrum of a sound. They are derived from a type of cepstral representation of the audio clip.

### Significance in Speech Recognition
MFCCs are particularly valuable because they:

- Approximate the human auditory system's response
- Provide a compact representation of the speech signal
- Capture important phonetic characteristics

## Gaussian Mixture Models

### Mathematical Foundation
GMMs are probabilistic models that assume all data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions. The model is defined by:

$$
p(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_k, \Sigma_k)
$$

where:
- $K$ is the number of components
- $\pi_k$ are the mixture weights
- $\mu_k$ and $\Sigma_k$ are the mean and covariance of each Gaussian component

### Application to Speech Analysis
GMMs are particularly well-suited for speech analysis because they can:

- Model complex distributions
- Capture multiple modes in the feature space
- Provide probabilistic assignments of data points
